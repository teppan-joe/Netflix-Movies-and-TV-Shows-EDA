# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-EDA

## About
The Netflix TV Shows and Movies dataset provides comprehensive information about various titles available on the popular streaming platform. The dataset includes details such as the title's name, its type (whether it is a TV show or a movie), a brief description of the content, the year it was released, age certification rating, runtime (for TV shows: length of episodes; for movies: duration), IMDb score, and IMDb votes.

This project contains Exploratory Data Analysis and visualizations of Movies and TV Shows on Netflix using Python based on release year, age certification, IMDB Score, IMDB Votes, and playtime.
